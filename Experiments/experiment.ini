# models need to be registered
# needs to be a valid inference string for venture,or a stub indicating handwritten or matlab inference.
# Every inference string is only one iteration (so that we can do stuff with it without having to
# rely on ventures collecting mechanisms. The actual number of interations is controlled by what comes after the colon.
# every single model must have at least one exerperimental setting for inference, more than one can be in
# indicated with ';'.
# commas indicate more than one infer statement, in the ordered that is supplied
# Todo: need to break down cycles so that we can easily collect was i happening inside a cycle
